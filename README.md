# Edits by me
 - page length increased from 500 to 575cm (breaks after roughly that size)
 - increased margin on the top, left, and right side looks better.
 - Wasn't happy with overriding `section`, so created a separate `pageBreakSection` instead.
  

# Future work
- Instead of footnotes, I want `Tufte-latex` style margin comments. Not footnotes that involve scrolling.
